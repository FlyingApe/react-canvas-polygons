# React Canvas Polygons

It is a react component that helps you draw line rectangles and any polygon with canvas on top of images.

Everything that you draw is stored in a state. You can access this state through the property `onCompleteDraw`.

This component was designed to draw fences which are used by computer vision application in the back end.

The points saved are relative to the canvas size. It follows the browser coordinate system (0, 0) on the top left.

## Installation

```
npm i -E react-canvas-polygons
```

## Usage Example

```js
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';
import type from 'prop-types';
import { CircularProgress } from '@material-ui/core';
import Canvas from 'react-canvas-polygons';

class DrawCanvas extends React.PureComponent {

    handleCleanCanva = () => this.canva.cleanCanvas();

    render() {
        const { imageInfo, tool, onCompleteDraw, fenceData } = this.props;
        const imageInfoLength = Object.keys(imageInfo).length === 0;

        return(
            <Suspense fallback={<CircularProgress color="secondary" />}>
                <button variant="outlined" style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}
                    onClick={this.handleCleanCanva}
                >
                    Clean Canvas
                </button>
                {imageInfoLength &&
                    <CircularProgress color="secondary" />
                }
                <Canvas
                    ref={canva => this.canva = canva}
                    imgSrc={imageInfo.url}
                    height={imageInfo.height}
                    width={imageInfo.width}
                    tool={tool}
                    onCompleteDraw={onCompleteDraw}
                    initialData={fenceData}
                />
            </Suspense>
        );
    }
}

export default DrawCanvas;

DrawCanvas.propTypes = {
    tool: type.string,
    imageInfo: type.object,
};
```

## Cleaning the canvas

Use a reference to the object and call cleanCanvas() method like demonstrate in the example above

```js
    handleCleanCanva = () => this.canva.cleanCanvas();
```

This will clean the canvas and reset the component state.

## TODO
- We should track what we are drawing so it would make easier to cancel or undo
